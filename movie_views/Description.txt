Choosen Approch to solve the given problem 



    1. The movie views has to be estimated for the unknown values with just 5 values given as a ground truth.
    2. I have choosen to start with basic linear regression, XGBoost regression and Random Forest regressor to solve this problem.
    3. I trained the model with those 5 rows which had the ground truth values and applied the predictions for the unknown values and estimated the views.
    4. I found out that none of the model was working better becuase statiscally it not right method to proceed with since no enough ground truth.

Cons:

    * It is not statiscally right to work with the dataset because, it had very few ground truth value to actually learn any pattern from the dataset.
    * In real life situations this data cannot be used to estimate other values since lack of ground truth.
    * There should be enough ground truth value to train and apply some rules to predict the estimated to a reasonable value. 
    * Since there's little ground truth there's no enough information to find the quality of the estimation how good it is.



Alternative Approch:

The data should have enough data points for the ground truth value to estimate its quality of the outcome. In real life this data would not be useful or even 
modelled to estimate any thing. Since it doesn't produce any statiscally significant value. A alternate approch would collect more data to evaluate the ground truth.
