Question: 
    You are given millions of movies and a list of thousands of movie categories (names
    only e.g. “Sci Fi Movies”, “Romantic Movies”). Your task is to assign each movie to at
    least one of the movie categories. Each movie has a title, description and poster.

Answer :

 *  Process 1: By searching each category keyword in the movie description column, each movie is assigned a specific category. Whenever a category keyword appears in a movie description, it corresponds to a specific category. 
   Each movie will be assigned a specific category. Assigning the movie to relevant categories will be accomplished by iterating the categories through all the movie descriptions.

 * To verify the quality of the mapping I would research in the internet to check few movie with its categories to check its quality.

 * If new category is added/ removed to the existing list, re Iterating the entire previous process (1) will work.

 * If a new movie is added to the existing file, iterating process (1) to the incoming movie would assign its matching category.

 Pros : 
    * Straightforward approch 
    * Works for medium or small size datasets 
    
Cons : 
    * Consumes much time to map if the datasets is huge. O(n) complexity. 
    * Time increases with number of inputs and vice versa
